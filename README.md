## 📜 Introduction

This password manager is a command-line tool designed to securely store and manage your account credentials. It uses encryption to protect your sensitive data and provides functionalities to add, retrieve, update, and delete account details.

## ✨ Features

- **Secure Encryption**: Utilizes the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm for robust data encryption, ensuring that sensitive account details are securely stored.
- **Easy Account Management**: Provides a straightforward command-line interface (CLI) for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting account details, making it simple to manage your credentials.
- **Persistent Storage**: Stores encrypted account information locally in a file (`passwords.pickle`), ensuring that your data remains accessible across sessions while maintaining security.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs and edge cases, enhancing the overall user experience and preventing unexpected behavior.
- **Extensibility**: Designed with a modular structure that allows for easy integration of new features and enhancements, making the password manager adaptable to evolving user needs.
- **Community Contributions**: Open-source project inviting contributions from the community to improve and enhance its functionality, fostering collaboration and innovation in the field of password management.

## 🚀 Usage

To use the password manager, follow these steps:
1. Run the script.
2. Choose from the available options:
    - Add Account
    - List Accounts
    - Retrieve Account Details
    - Update Account Details
    - Delete Account
    - Exit

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-manager.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd password-manager
```
3. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
4 Install the required dependencies (see Dependencies).

## 🔧 Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python library:

cryptography: Used for encryption and decryption operations.
You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## 📝 Notes
Encryption: The password manager leverages the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm from the cryptography library. Fernet ensures secure encryption and decryption of sensitive data. It uses a symmetric key, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This approach provides a balance between security and ease of use, as only those with access to the key can decrypt the data.

Data Storage: Account details are stored locally in a file named passwords.pickle. This file contains encrypted data, ensuring that even if the file is compromised, the sensitive information remains protected. The use of serialization via the pickle module allows for efficient storage and retrieval of Python objects. However, it's essential to note that while encryption adds a layer of security, it's not foolproof. Users should still exercise caution and ensure the security of their encryption keys and files.

Usage: The script provides a simple yet effective command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the password manager. Users can easily add, retrieve, update, and delete account details based on their requirements. The interactive nature of the CLI makes it user-friendly and accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical expertise. Additionally, the script includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs and edge cases, enhancing the overall user experience.

Security Considerations: While encryption helps protect sensitive data, it's essential to consider other security aspects, such as key management and secure communication channels. Proper key management practices, such as storing keys securely and rotating them periodically, are crucial for maintaining the integrity of encrypted data. Additionally, ensuring that the password manager is used in a secure environment and that users exercise caution when handling sensitive information further enhances security.
